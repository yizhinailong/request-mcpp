# Repository Guidelines

## Project Purpose & Reference

`request-mcpp` is an HTTP client library project implemented with [cpr](https://github.com/yizhinailong/cpr) as its reference. Consult cpr's APIs, implementation, and tests when developing request methods, options, sessions, responses, and error handling. Adapt designs to C++23 modules and `mcpp`, and document intentional API or behavior differences in pull requests.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Source files are grouped by responsibility. Public module names are independent of file paths. Request configuration types use `mcr::options`, with TLS option tags in `mcr::options::ssl`. Reusable utilities use `mcr::utils`, and curl backend interfaces use `mcr::curl`.

- `src/mcr.cppm`: library entry module re-exporting the public interfaces.
- `src/options/`: request transfer configuration in namespace `mcr::options`, including verbosity, timeouts, redirects, protocol selection, authentication, proxies, and TLS options. Each option keeps its existing module name, such as `mcr.verbose` or `mcr.timeout`.
- `src/utils/`: reusable utilities in namespace `mcr::utils` for secure strings, singleton lifecycle, thread pools, future wrappers, and the filesystem alias `mcr::utils::fs`, alongside HTTP parsing and curl callback helpers. Utility modules retain their existing module names, such as `mcr.threadpool` and `mcr.util`.
- `src/curl/`: curl easy/multi handle ownership and SSL context support in namespace `mcr::curl`, including module interfaces and their implementations. These modules retain their existing module names, such as `mcr.curlholder` and `mcr.ssl_ctx`.
- `src/`: sessions, responses, request data, callbacks, and supporting runtime modules.
- `tests/test_*.cpp`: standalone tests, with shared local HTTP fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`.
- `mcpp.toml`: package metadata and dependency declarations for `mcr`.
- `.clang-format`: repository formatting configuration.
- `target/`, `.mcpp/`, and `compile_commands.json`: generated output or local state ignored by Git; do not commit them.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Run from the repository root with `mcpp` and a C++23 toolchain supporting `import std;`.

- `mcpp self doctor`: diagnose the local build environment.
- `mcpp build`: compile the application.
- `mcpp run`: build and run the default executable.
- `mcpp run -- example`: pass a command-line argument.
- `mcpp test`: discover, build, and execute tests under `tests/`.
- `mcpp build --configure-only`: generate the editor compilation database.
- `mcpp clean`: remove generated build output under `target/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow `.clang-format`: four-space indentation, spaces instead of tabs, and no enforced column limit. Format changed C++ files, for example:

```sh
clang-format -i src/main.cpp tests/test_smoke.cpp
```

Preserve C++23 module style, including `import std;`. Use lowercase filenames with underscores, such as `argument_parser.cpp`, and keep implementation in `src/`. No separate lint configuration is checked in.

Use Doxygen documentation comments: `/** ... */` with `@brief`, `@param`, `@tparam`, `@return`, and `@throws` where applicable, and `///<` for member descriptions.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests are standalone programs with their own `main()`; no external framework is configured. Follow `tests/test_*.cpp`, with one executable per file. Return zero on success and nonzero on failure. Cover changed behavior and edge cases, then run `mcpp test`. For HTTP tests, use a local fixture server with controlled responses. The smoke test checks compilation and execution; no coverage threshold is configured.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use prefixes such as `feat:` and `style:` with short, imperative descriptions. Follow that pattern, for example `feat: add argument parsing`.

Keep changes focused. In each pull request, describe the behavior change, link related issues when applicable, and report validation commands and results. Include before-and-after terminal output when changing CLI behavior.
